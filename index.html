            <h1>Let's Help Those Who Are More In Need</h1>
            <p>Some people are less fortunate; life is not kind to all of us. While you might be lucky enough to live a
                comfortable life, others don't have a roof over their head or food to put on the table. You won't be
                able to help everyone in need, but your gesture, no matter how small, will definitely make a difference.
